I recently completed training for a private pilot certificate and decided to share details on how much it cost me.

I trained in [San Carlos Flight Center](https://sancarlosflight.com).
And it took two and a half years for me to go from zero to Private Pilot License.
The total flight time is 140 hours.

The diagram below shows a cost structure.

{{< html4-get-bundle-image "diagram.png" "cost" "100%" >}}

* Equipment is all the tools I need for flying: headset, sentry, flashlight, etc.
* Fees - all fees I paid: TSA, fingerprints, DPE, knowledge exam.
* Indirect costs - here, I tracked transportation, car maintenance, club membership, renter insurance, and other costs which are not directly related to flight training.
